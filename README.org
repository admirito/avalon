* Avalon

=Avalon= is a extendable scalable high-performance streaming data
generator that can be used to simulate the real-time input for various
systems.

The =Avalan= name is based on the name of a legendary island featured
in the Arthurian legend and it has nothing to do with the proprietary
[[https://www.spirent.com/products/avalanche-security-testing][Spirent Avalanche]] traffic generator.
